# Kanban Board

A browser-based Kanban Board built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a simple and effective way to manage tasks visually by organizing them into three columns: To Do, Doing, and Done. It is fully client-side and uses localStorage to preserve tasks across sessions without requiring a server.

## Description

This project is a lightweight and interactive task management tool. Users can add, edit, delete, and move tasks between columns using a simple interface. Each task is time-stamped when created and displayed in a card format. Drag-and-drop functionality allows tasks to be moved between workflow stages, and each column shows a live count of its tasks.

All task data is stored using the browser's localStorage, ensuring persistence even after closing the browser. The layout is responsive and works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

This project demonstrates practical use of core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, drag-and-drop, and localStorageâ€”all implemented without external libraries or frameworks.
